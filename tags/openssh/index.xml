      <description>You are behind a restrictive firewall and you aspire to more freedom? You need to access an Intranet website located in a different environment than yours? You are far from your home country, and can&amp;rsquo;t live one minute more without your favourite TV shows, that you can&amp;rsquo;t watch because of the localisation restrictions?
You can communicate via port 22? Do you have an SSH server that could access the content you want?</description>

      <description>Password authentication is good but can be dangerous, because it is weak against brute force attacks. There are some mechanisms which allow to mitigate this treat. There are also safer authentication mechanisms for SSH, like public key auhtentication.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to create a key pair from our client, a public and a private. We send the public key to the server. Thus, when the client tries to connect, the server communicates by encrypting communications with the public key.</description>
