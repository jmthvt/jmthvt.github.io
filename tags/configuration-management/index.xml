      <description>Here is a prensetation about Puppet, written by me. It briefly discusses the configuration managers, before looking in more detail Puppet, its installation based on Debian, its initial configuration and its declarative language. This medium is intended for beginners inÂ configuration management, who want to discover Puppet.
